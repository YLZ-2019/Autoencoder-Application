File 'creditcard.csv' can't be added to GitHub because the file 'creditcard.csv' is 143.84 MB and this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB. Therefore, I added file 'creditcardfraud.zip' to GitHub.

File 'Fraud_Detection.ipynb' is tested on the Google Colab which uses Google Drive, so please pay attention to the 'path' in the file.

Thank you for going through.
